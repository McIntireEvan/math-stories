In the words of one of my favorite professors, I want to "tell stories" about math. It goes without saying that rigorous proofs are vital for a mathematician's development. That said, I believe that having intuitive "stories" about these proofs and ideas can make things go a lot easier.

I want to help create intuition about these subjects, and create explanations that my non-mathematician friends can understand and appreciate.

I'll try to have a new post every other Sunday.

If anything I write is incorrect or misleading, let me know! Make an [issue on Github](https://github.com/McIntireEvan/math-stories/issues) or get in touch [over email](mailto:mcintire.evan@gmail.com).
