In my second year of undergrad, I took a small course on visualization using Mathematica. While I didn't learn much new math, I found Mathematica to be a great enviroment to explore concepts in. For our final project, we got to pick and present our own topic. I used these skills to learn about fractional deviatirves. Recently, I dove a bit further into them. Today, I'll discuss a lot of cool things!!!!

# Derivatives: A Recap

- derivatives
- taylor series!
- If we want the power to be a rational, then we have to fix some stuff first

# Extending the factorial: The Gamma Function

- Generalizes factorial
- Show a graphy graph

# Taylor Series Analysis

- we know how to derivative of polynomial in general form
- since we can write any function as a taylor series, we can write as a sum of polynomials
- wow we're in business!

- show some examples
  - sin, cos, exp

# A More General Approach

As fun as that is, it's difficult, and there are plenty of extra special functions. How do we come up with a general form?

- we actually do the integral first (thanks cauchy :))
- and then by taking the derivative, we reach what we want

# Code

Before I wrote this post, I wrote mathematica and sage packages. Try them out, and feel free to contribute if there are any issues.
